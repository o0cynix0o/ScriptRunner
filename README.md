# ScriptRunner
I hear you like scripts, so I wrote a script that runs scripts.

### Running the script

Replace "C:\Path\to\your\script.ps1" with the actual path to your desired PowerShell script.

Save this script with a .ps1 extension, then when you run it, it will open a GUI window with a button labeled "Run Script". When you click this button, it will execute the PowerShell script specified in $scriptPath.
